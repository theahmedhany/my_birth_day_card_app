# My Birthday Card App
A new Flutter Application.

## Description

The **Birthday Card** application is an introductory Flutter project designed to provide beginners with a foundational understanding of working with image assets and text rendering within a mobile application. Upon launching the app, users are greeted by a vibrant and colorful birthday card, set against a soft pastel background. The centerpiece of the card is a bright, multi-tiered cake adorned with candles and star-shaped decorations, illustrated in a modern and playful graphic style.

Prominently displayed below the cake is the message **Happy Birthday,** rendered in a stylish outline font that complements the card's vibrant color scheme. The app's design prioritizes simplicity and elegance, focusing on essential elements to create a visually appealing and functional birthday greeting.
